# Untargeted Metabolomics Feature Clustering

This page contains the supporting files for the paper *VOCCluster: Untargeted Metabolomics Feature Clustering Approach for Clinical Breath Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry Data* by Alkhalifah et al. (2019).

- **data**  contains the files that are required to be entered to the VOCCluster and any file that is generated from the aalgorithem.

- **DBSCAN** contains DBSCAN algorthem that is coded in Python.

- **OPTICS** contains OPTICS algorithem that is coded in Python.

- **VOCCluster** contains VOCCluster algorithem that is coded in Python.

- Note: All of the algorithems read the required files from data folder to generate clusters for the given data.
